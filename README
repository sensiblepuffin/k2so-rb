A Discord bot written in Ruby.

Originally designed to make my friends laugh, but ever since I got fed up with Node.js (too many broken Promises, heh), it's been half that and half learning opportunity.

I use Heroku for their free plan. If you want to run this on your own Heroku dyno, you'll need buildpacks for the following:

* libsodium
* ffmpeg
* libopus

And obviously, the multipack buildpack. These are the ones that I use:

https://github.com/renanoronfle/heroku-multipack.git
https://github.com/JustinLove/heroku-buildpack-libsodium.git
https://github.com/shunjikonishi/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg.git
https://github.com/Crazycatz00/heroku-buildpack-libopus.git

Obviously if you're running it on a personal server or in some other instance, you'll have to make sure these dependencies are installed.
